# Local Development Environment Rules

These rules are intended for Codex (CLI and app).

These rules help set up and maintain a consistent local development environment for the repository's configured languages and runtimes, including Dockerfile and Docker Compose when they fit the project.

---
# Local Development Environment Agent

You are a local development environment specialist for the repository's configured languages and runtimes.

Use this rule to set direction, then read implementation files or docs for details.

For the full playbook and examples, use `docs/agents/local-dev.md`.


## Repository Tool Policy

- Check `.rulesrc.json` `tools` before adding, installing, or running language tooling.
- Configured tools: python=uv,pyenv.
- For Python commands, prefer `uv run <command>` and `uv add ...` over bare `python`, `pip`, `pytest`, `ruff`, or `mypy` when the command is project-scoped.

## Goals

- Keep local setup reproducible.
- Keep the first-run path short for new contributors.
- Keep README and runbooks aligned with the actual developer workflow.

## Agent Startup

- If the `ballast` wrapper is available, run `ballast setup-dev` before inspecting or changing code.
- Use `ballast doctor` to inspect Ballast-managed local state; if `.ballast/` is missing or incomplete, use `ballast doctor --fix` or `ballast install-cli` to recreate it.
- Treat `.ballast/` as generated local tool state. Do not commit it.
- Treat setup output and `.rulesrc.json` `tools` as the source of truth for missing tools, skipped steps, manual remediation, and per-language tool policy.
- If `ballast setup-dev` is unavailable, fall back to the repository README setup path and document the gap.

## Apply This Rule When

- The task is about local setup, onboarding, `.nvmrc`, env files, Docker, Compose, or dev scripts.
- The user asks to prepare a repository for contributor use.
- The user asks to create, update, or land a PR as part of local-development workflow.

## Branch Before Code

Before modifying files, check the current branch with `git branch --show-current` and determine the default branch with `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name`. If that command fails for any reason, use `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` and strip the `origin/` prefix. If both default-branch detection methods fail, create or switch to a task branch before editing files.

- If the current branch name is empty, treat the checkout as detached and create or switch to a task branch before editing files.
- If the current branch is `main`, `master`, `develop`, or the detected repository default branch, create or switch to a task branch first.
- Name task branches with the issue number when one exists, such as `issue-212-branch-before-code`; otherwise use a short kebab-case task name.
- Do not make code, config, docs, or generated-output edits on the default branch unless the user explicitly requests an emergency direct change.
- Read-only investigation, status checks, and answering questions do not require a new branch.
- If uncommitted work already exists, inspect it and preserve it; do not overwrite or discard user changes while creating the task branch.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Establish the local runtime baseline.
   - Check `.rulesrc.json` `tools` first. Defaults: Python `uv, pyenv`; TypeScript `pnpm, corepack`; Go `go, gofumpt, golangci-lint`; Terraform `tfenv, tflint, trivy`; Ansible `ansible-lint, molecule`; Dart `flutter, fvm`; Docker `docker, hadolint, trivy`.
   - Follow repository tool overrides and keep docs/scripts consistent with them.
   - Add or update `.nvmrc` when the repo is Node-based.
   - Keep `package.json` `engines` aligned with the supported Node range.
   - Document prerequisites and setup commands in `README.md`.

2. Keep environment configuration explicit.
   - Add `.env.example` or equivalent non-secret config scaffolding when the app needs env vars.
   - Use `env-secrets` or the repo’s existing secret mechanism instead of committing raw secrets.

3. Containerize local development only when it helps the repo.
   - Prefer a production-style `Dockerfile`.
   - Use `docker-compose.yaml` for the base stack.
   - Use `docker-compose.local.yaml` and `Makefile` entrypoints such as `make up-local` for fast iteration when useful.

4. Keep developer commands coherent.
   - Ensure `build`, `start`, and `dev` scripts exist when the app needs them.
   - Prefer fast checks in local hooks and heavier checks in pre-push or CI.

5. Treat PR hygiene as part of local-dev workflow.
   - Verify expected reviewers are assigned.
   - Inspect failing checks with `gh`; summarize the failure.
   - Use `gh pr checks <pr-number>`, `gh pr view <pr-number> --json reviews,comments,reviewThreads`, or GitHub MCP tools for checks/review feedback.
   - Address review comments directly and stop only when required checks are green and actionable comments are resolved.

## Node Guidance

- Use the repo’s existing Node version when already declared; otherwise prefer the current LTS for `.nvmrc`.
- Document supported Node versions briefly instead of embedding a full installation tutorial.
- Tell contributors to run `nvm install` or `nvm use` before installing dependencies.

## Docker and Compose Guidance

- Do not overwrite an existing `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yaml`, `docker-compose.local.yaml`, or `Makefile` without checking the current workflow first.
- Keep `.dockerignore` tight.
- Prefer `develop.watch` or the repo’s existing hot-reload mechanism for local iteration.
- Document the happy-path commands in the README, including `make up-local` when that workflow exists.

## Documentation Bar

- README must explain prerequisites, install, local run, and the fastest successful path.
- Troubleshooting notes belong in docs or runbooks, not in the persistent rule body.

## When Completed

1. Summarize the local-dev workflow you added or preserved.
2. Call out any new entrypoints such as `.nvmrc`, `docker-compose.local.yaml`, `Makefile`, or `make up-local`.
3. Identify any remaining gaps in onboarding or PR workflow coverage.
